3.0.0,"We compare MI-SVM (heuristic and mip), SMM, and MI-SMM (heuristic) based on a principled approach of using all combinations of features for MI-SVM.  The 4 combinations use the rbf kernel and choices of univariate features (skew, kurtosis, 25th percentile, 75th percentile), multivariate features (2-way correlations), neither, or both.
